# Running-Game-with-PyGame
First time making a game using Pygame. Modified a few aspects of the game from the original tutorial video i followed.

URL for the original game tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk
What I modified from the original game:

- Changed the scoring system
The original game from the tutorial uses time to score the game. I modified this and changed the scoring system to collecting coins. Each time a player successfully grabs a coin, one point is added to the player's score.

- Added high score feature
Tracks the player score from each play and stores the highest value as their high score. Also tells the player when a new high score is reached

- Separated starting screen from restarting screen
In the original tutorial video, the creator only changed the size of the object and text for different screens.
I made it so that the starting screen is completely separated from the restarting screen.
